# Plot.ly-Homework

I cannot get the page to populate - I keep getting the following error: 

 "Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at file:///C:/Users/Stephanie/Desktop/02-Homework/Instructions/StarterCode/samples.json. (Reason: CORS request not http)."
 
 I tried to use python -m http.server but it still populated the same error.
 
 Please grade based on my code/hopefully it will run on your computer and this is just a host issue.
